Experiment on generative arts using [canvas sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch). 

Following is to setup framework and run file. Note that canvas-sketch-cli won't work if not global.
```
# Install the CLI tool globally
npm install canvas-sketch-cli -g

# Make a new folder to hold all your generative sketches
mkdir my-sketches

# Move into that folder
cd my-sketches

# Scaffold a new 'sketch.js' file and run on the browser
canvas-sketch sketch.js --new --open
```
